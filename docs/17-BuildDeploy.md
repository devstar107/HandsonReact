## Build

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Inside the `build/static` directory will be your JavaScript and CSS files. Each filename inside of `build/static` will contain a unique hash of the file contents. This hash in the file name enables [long term caching techniques](#static-file-caching).

When running a production build of freshly created Create React App application, there are a number of `.js` files (called _chunks_) that are generated and placed in the `build/static/js` directory:

`main.[hash].chunk.js`

- This is your _application_ code. `App.js`, etc.

`[number].[hash].chunk.js`

- These files can either be _vendor_ code, or **code splitting chunks**. _Vendor_ code includes modules that you've imported from within `node_modules`. One of the potential advantages with splitting your _vendor_ and _application_ code is to enable [long term caching techniques](#static-file-caching) to improve application loading performance. Since _vendor_ code tends to change less often than the actual _application_ code, the browser will be able to cache them separately, and won't re-download them each time the app code changes.

`runtime-main.[hash].js`

- This is a small chunk of [webpack runtime](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimization-runtimechunk) logic which is used to load and run your application. The contents of this will be embedded in your `build/index.html` file by default to save an additional network request. You can opt out of this by specifying `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false`, which will load this chunk instead of embedding it in your `index.html`.

If you're using **code splitting** to split up your application, this will create additional chunks in the `build/static` folder as well.

## Deploy

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file. For more information see the [production build](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/production-build) section of the Create React App documentation.

## Static Server

For environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-l` or `--listen` flags:

```sh
serve -s build -l 4000
```

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```sh
serve -h
```

## Other Solutions

You don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.

Here’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/):

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(9000);
```

The choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.

The `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.

However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.

## Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing

If you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.

This is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:

```diff
 app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));

-app.get('/', function (req, res) {
+app.get('/*', function (req, res) {
   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
 });
```

If you’re using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), you need to create a `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder that looks like this:

```
    Options -MultiViews
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```

It will get copied to the `build` folder when you run `npm run build`.

If you’re using [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), you need to follow [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41249464/4878474).

Now requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production.

## Building for Relative Paths

By default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.

To override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:

```js
  "homepage": "http://mywebsite.com/relativepath",
```

This will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.

**Note**: If you are using `react-router@^4`, you can root `<Link>`s using the `basename` prop on any `<Router>`.<br />
More information [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter/basename-string).<br />

<br />
For example:

```js
<BrowserRouter basename="/calendar"/>
<Link to="/today"/> // renders <a href="/calendar/today">
```

### Serving the Same Build from Different Paths

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.

If you are not using the HTML5 `pushState` history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your `package.json`:

```js
  "homepage": ".",
```

This will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to `index.html`. You will then be able to move your app from `http://mywebsite.com` to `http://mywebsite.com/relativepath` or even `http://mywebsite.com/relative/path` without having to rebuild it.

## Customizing Environment Variables for Arbitrary Build Environments

You can create an arbitrary build environment by creating a custom `.env` file and loading it using [env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd).

For example, to create a build environment for a staging environment:

1. Create a file called `.env.staging`
1. Set environment variables as you would any other `.env` file (e.g. `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://api-staging.example.com`)
1. Install [env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd)
   ```sh
   $ npm install env-cmd --save
   $ # or
   $ yarn add env-cmd
   ```
1. Add a new script to your `package.json`, building with your new environment:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build:staging": "env-cmd -f .env.staging npm run build"
     }
   }
   ```

Now you can run `npm run build:staging` to build with the staging environment config.
You can specify other environments in the same way.

Variables in `.env.production` will be used as fallback because `NODE_ENV` will always be set to `production` for a build.

## Static File Caching

Each file inside of the `build/static` directory will have a unique hash appended to the filename that is generated based on the contents of the file, which allows you to use [aggressive caching techniques](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#invalidating_and_updating_cached_responses) to avoid the browser re-downloading your assets if the file contents haven't changed. If the contents of a file changes in a subsequent build, the filename hash that is generated will be different.

To deliver the best performance to your users, it's best practice to specify a `Cache-Control` header for `index.html`, as well as the files within `build/static`. This header allows you to control the length of time that the browser as well as CDNs will cache your static assets. If you aren't familiar with what `Cache-Control` does, see [this article](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/) for a great introduction.

Using `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000` for your `build/static` assets, and `Cache-Control: no-cache` for everything else is a safe and effective starting point that ensures your user's browser will always check for an updated `index.html` file, and will cache all of the `build/static` files for one year. Note that you can use the one year expiration on `build/static` safely because the file contents hash is embedded into the filename.
