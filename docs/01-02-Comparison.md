## React, Angular, Vue Compared

JavaScript libraries and frameworks have more similarities than differences. The reality is that they borrow ideas from each other to improve the JavaScript ecosystem.

### React

- Facebook
- Components
- Library
- Just the View in MVC
- Need to include other libraries
  - React Router (Routing)
  - HTTP: Axios or fetch API
- ES6 (Babel compiler) or TypeScript (tsc compiler)
- Create React App
- Uses Webpack
- Redux

### Angular

- Google
- Components
- Framework
- Modular
- Component Router
- HttpClient
- Forms
- Usually TypeScript (tsc compiler)
- Angular CLI
- Uses Webpack
- Reactive Extensions for Angular (ngrx)

### Vue

- Community
  - Started by former Google Technologist and Meteor core team member Evan You
- Components
- Framework
- Modular
- Vue Router (official Router)
- Need to include other libraries
  - HTTP: Axios or fetch API
  - Forms
- ES6 (Babel compiler) or TypeScript (tsc compiler)
- Vue CLI
- Vuex (State Management)

### React, Angular, Vue: Key Insights

> **Angular** continues to put **“JS”** **into HTML**. **React** puts **“HTML” into JS**. – Cory House

- Vue and Angular have templates which are often favored by developers without as much JavaScript experience
- React does not have templates because it just relies on JavaScript combined with JSX so it is often favored by developers who are fluent in JavaScript
- Angular is a more comprehensive framework while React is more of a targeted micro library. Vue can starts as a micro library and scales to a comprehensive framework.
- Because React and Vue are smaller they can be:
  - Easier to understand
    - Vue even more than React because of its use of templates and excellent documentation
  - Easier to include in a project
- React is much more popular (but has existed longer)
- React and Vue is used more by design/digital/interactive agencies to build interactive websites as well as in the applications in an enterprise
- Angular is used more for building applications in the enterprise, particularly at larger organizations, and is getting better for website use cases
