## Create New ES6 Project

[Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) is an officially supported way to create single-page React
applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the commands:

### npm

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm
cd my-app
npm start
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

2. Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.

   > If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, it is recommended that you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` to ensure that `npx` always uses the latest version.

## Create New TypeScript Project

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the commands:

### npm

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm --template typescript
```

### Yarn

```
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

1. Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack. You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`. Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories. They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

If you have Git installed and your project is not part of a larger repository, then a new repository will be initialized resulting in an additional top-level `.git` directory.

## Browser Support

By default, the generated project supports all modern browsers. Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires polyfills. For a set of polyfills to support older browsers, use [react-app-polyfill](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).

### Supported Language Features

This project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard. In addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:

- [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).
- [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).
- [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018).
- [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 3 proposal)
- [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (part of stage 3 proposal).

Learn more about [different proposal stages](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

While we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.

Note that **this project includes no [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md)** by default.

If you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are [including the appropriate polyfills manually](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md), or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.

By default, the generated project includes a [`browserslist`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) configuration in your `package.json` file to target a broad range of browsers based on global usage (`> 0.2%`) for production builds, and modern browsers for development.

The `browserslist` configuration controls the outputted JavaScript so that the emitted code will be compatible with the browsers specified. The `browserslist` configuration does not automatically change what polyfills are included in the build it affects the code generated by the compiler that emits JavaScript.

### Polyfills

#### react-app-polyfill

This package includes polyfills for various browsers.
It includes minimum requirements and commonly used language features used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) projects.

### Usage

First, install the package using Yarn or npm:

```sh
npm install react-app-polyfill
```

or

```sh
yarn add react-app-polyfill
```

For IE11:

```js
// These must be the first lines in src/index.js
import "react-app-polyfill/ie11";
import "react-app-polyfill/stable";

// ...
```

> See the [react-app-polyfill documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md) for details.

> The react-app-polyfill can be used to fill in the Fetch API to make AJAX requests in older browsers. [For more details, read this documentation.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/fetching-data-with-ajax-requests)

## Styles and Assets

This project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:

#### `Button.css`

```css
.Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

#### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./Button.css"; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // You can use them as regular CSS styles
    return <div className="Button" />;
  }
}
```

**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-blog/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.

In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.

If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.

## Dependencies

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-router-dom
```

This works for any library, not just `react-router-dom`.

## Uses Webpack

As previously mentioned, Create React App internally uses WebPack to build your application. If you are curious, you can see [the WebPack configuration file in GitHub here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js).
